# UART 32-bit Serializer and Deserializer

## Overview

This project implements a simple UART-based data transmission system capable of transferring 32-bit data over a standard 8-bit UART interface.

The design consists of two major blocks:

1. **Serializer (Transmitter Side)**
   - Accepts a 32-bit parallel input.
   - Splits the 32-bit word into four 8-bit bytes.
   - Sequentially transmits each byte through the UART transmitter.

2. **Deserializer (Receiver Side)**
   - Receives four 8-bit UART packets.
   - Reconstructs the original 32-bit data word.
   - Generates a valid signal once all four bytes are received.

## Verification

The design was verified using a SystemVerilog testbench that performs end-to-end validation of the serializer, UART transmitter, UART receiver, and deserializer.

### Verification Objectives

- Verify correct serialization of 32-bit input data into four 8-bit UART packets.
- Verify correct UART transmission and reception.
- Verify byte ordering throughout the transmission process.
- Verify reconstruction of the original 32-bit data at the receiver.
- Verify proper operation of control signals such as `master_busy` and `master_write`.
